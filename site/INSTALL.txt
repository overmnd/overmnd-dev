How to use this fix:

1) Unzip into your repo root so the new file lands at:
   site/src/lib/auth/logout.ts

2) Update any imports that referenced your old logout util to:
   import { logoutAndRedirect } from '@/lib/auth/logout'   (if you use path aliases)
   or
   import { logoutAndRedirect } from '../lib/auth/logout'  (from components under site/src)

3) Ensure you have NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL set in your .env.local (Next.js):
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-domain.com

That's it. This avoids Vite's `import.meta.env` and uses Next.js' `process.env` (via src/lib/env.ts).
